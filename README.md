This example contains [11ty Javascript Data Files](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-js/) that take Twitch provided clip data. The front end utilizes [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) for layout and styling. When code is committed or content is published, a build process is triggered that utilizes [GitHub Actions for GitHub Pages](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages) to build and deploy the website.

Getting started
=====


#### Build the site

* On the command line, navigate to your cloned repo and install your dependencies with `npm install`.
* Run Eleventy with `npx eleventy --serve`. We're using the `--serve` argument so eleventy will host the site for us. Navigiate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) (or whatever port 11ty provides you if 8080 is already in use) to view the site.
