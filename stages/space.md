## Immersive Paranal world
An equirectangular 360-degree panorama taken during the ESO Ultra HD Expedition captures ESO's Paranal Observatory. The four 8.2m Unit Telescopes (UTs) — Antu, Kueyen, Melipal and Yepun — can be seen below the milky Way, along with the four movable 1.8m diameter Auxiliary Telescopes (ATs), making up the Very Large Telescope (VLT). The telescopes can work together, to form a giant ‘interferometer’, the ESO Very Large Telescope Interferometer, allowing astronomers to see details up to 25 times finer than with the individual telescopes.
