## 360° video prevents filmmaker bias.
There’s been a lot of interest in 360° video in journalism because it presumably removes bias and helps maintain objectivity. Journalism, by definition, is meant to be objective and tell the facts, which is exactly what 360° videos do. When telling a story with 360° video, you can’t cut between scenes too fast, you can’t move the camera around too much, and it’s hard to edit within a scene without disorienting the viewer. Most creators place their camera on a tripod in the middle of the action. This lack of movement and editing between scenes makes it harder to inject bias into the story.
